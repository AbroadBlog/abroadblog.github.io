            <p>I have told myself for the longest time that I’m a creator, not a consumer. When I see this changing, I try to do something to remedy it. So often I find it’s easy to just sit on Reddit or Facebook and endlessly scroll as my eyes grow tired and I grow bored of looking at a screen. While a little bit of this is okay and normal, doing this to the extent that some do is dangerous. It leads to apathy. It leads to unwarranted contentment. And it inhibits creation and self-growth. Therefore, I shall create.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, I set out to keep a travel log. This is more for myself than anyone else, though I wouldn’t be mad if someone wanted to read about my travel experience or see how to travel Europe inexpensively. As I’ve watched my friends go abroad for the past 3 years, I’ve noticed they all post pictures on Instagram and endlessly try to “out-do” each other on Snapchat. It becomes a contest of who is having the most fun or who has traveled to the most places. I want to avoid this.</p>

<p>This trip is for me. This log is for me. I want to enjoy my time in Europe and I honestly don’t care if people think I had fun or not…I mean, obviously it’s me. I can make anything fun, lol!</p>

<p>A long while ago I noticed a quote about my generation.</p>

<div class="quotation">
  <blockquote>
    Stop capturing the moment and simply enjoy it.
  </blockquote>
</div>

<p>Millenials get a lot of shit. We’re the “soft” generation. We’re the slaves to technology. We are constantly blamed for the world’s problems by boomers, and we don’t really do anything right… but this criticism I agree with. We need to stop living behind screens, stop living to impress each other, and we need to just live. The world is more globalized than it has ever been before and we (especially Americans) have been met with incomparable opportunities. This is my attempt at that. I’m enjoying the moment, remembering it, and reporting back.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
